# APPS10: Options for Building and Running Your App in the Cloud  

## Session Abstract

Weâ€™ll show you how Tailwind Traders avoided a single point of failure, using cloud services to deploy their company website to multiple regions. Weâ€™ll cover all the options they considered, explain how and why they made their decisions, then dive into the components of their implementation.  

In this session, youâ€™ll see how they used Microsoft technologies like VS Code, Azure Portal, and Azure CLI to build a secure application that runs and scales on Linux and Windows VMs and Azure Web Apps, with a companion phone App.
