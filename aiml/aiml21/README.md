# AIML21: Developers Guide to AI: A Data Storyâ€¯

## Train-the-Trainer Guide**

### Session Abstract

In this theatre session we will show the data science process and how to apply it. From exploration of datasets to deployment of services - all applied to an interesting data story. This will also take you on a very brief tour of the Azure AI Platform.

# How to Use

# Demo Instructions:

Please download all the code and data files in this repository to get started. There is a code and data folder which will contain all information you need to run all demos

**You will need:**
* Azure Subscription - get a [free trial here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free) if you need it
* [Power BI Desktop (Windows Only)](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) - if you are running on MacOS/Linux you can still demo the functionality from any modern web browser

**Setup Instructions:**
* Use the deploy to Azure button below to create your Azure Machine Learning workspace to use throughout the session: **deploy to azure button**
* Log into the Azure Portal and your Azure Machine Learning Service
* Launch the Preview UI
* Create a Notebook VM
    * Select 'Notebook VMs' from left pane
    * Select 'New'
    * Provide a 'Notebook VM Name' (all lowercase)
    * Keep the default size VM provided
    * Once created select 'Jupyter Link'
    * Enter the user folder by double clicking
    * Select the upload button and upload the files listed below:
        * [data/data_train.csv](data/data_train.csv)
        * [code/explore.ipynb](code/explore.ipynb)
        * [code/deploy.ipynb](code/deploy.ipynb)
        * [code/config.json](code/config.json)

* Create a Compute Instance
    * Select 'Compute' from left pane
    * Select 'Add'
    * Provide a 'Compute Name' (all lowercase)
    * Select 'Machine Learning Compute' as Compute type
    * Choose a VM size
        * For standard compute select something like 'Standard_DS2_v2'
        * For GPU compute select 'Standard_NC6'
    * Select 'Low Priority' for Virtual machine priority
    * Minimum number of nodes set to 0 (then it will scale down completely and reduce costs)
    * Click 'Create'

* Upload the Dataset
    * Select 'Datasets' from left pane
    * Select 'Create dataset' and then 'from local files'
    * Select the 'Browse' button and find the data_train_experiment.csv file
    * Wait for the file to upload
    * Select 'Done'
